  x-api-slug: harvard-dash
  description: 'DASH is Harvard University????s digital repository for scholarly articles,
    dissertations, theses, and other literature generated by the Harvard educational
    community. Bibliographic data from DASH is available for all uses.  The Harvard
    DASH API provides bibliographic data from the repository via two standards: opensearch
    and OAI-PMH. OpenSearch is a RESTful interface that returns query results as RSS
    or ATOM feeds. The OAI-PMH standard is an application-independent framework based
    on metadata harvesting. It returns XML formatted data.'

- name: Harvard Faculty Finder
  x-api-slug: harvard-faculty-finder
  description: The Harvard Faculty Finder (HFF) provides a method by which students,
    faculty, administrators, and the general public can search for Harvard faculty
    members based on their research and teaching expertise. HFF is not a database
    of faculty profiles. Rather, it indexes and links existing information sources,
    making it possible to search and browse for faculty information across schools.
    Currently, only members of the Harvard community can make use of HFF, but that
    is expected to change later in the year.
